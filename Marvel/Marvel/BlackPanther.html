    <div class="p1div">
      <p>
        After the death of his father at the hands of the villainous Ulysses Klaw, T’Challa claimed the throne as well
        as the mantle of the Black Panther. Upon becoming the Black Panther, T’Challa was exposed to a mystical herb
        that enhanced his strength and agility to near-superhuman levels. After meeting the Fantastic Four, T’Challa
        decided his powers would be put to best use in the service of all humanity, although Wakanda traditionally had
        been closed to the outside world, and so he flew off to New York, leaving his people behind.

        National Book Award winner Ta-Nehisi Coates was tasked with writing the relaunched Black Panther comic, and the
        debut issue was one of the best-selling comics of 2016. The Black Panther entered the Marvel Cinematic Universe
        (MCU) later that year in Captain America: Civil War, a blockbuster that cast Chadwick Boseman as the Wakandan
        prince. The character subsequently experienced something of a renaissance, with the success of Coates’s flagship
        title leading to the release of Black Panther: World of Wakanda, a series that explored Wakanda’s other heroes,
        and Black Panther & the Crew, a street-level story set in Harlem. Each of those titles was canceled after just
        six issues, however, because of low sales.

        Director Ryan Coogler helmed Black Panther (2018), a dazzling spectacle that saw Boseman return to the screen in
        the role of T’Challa. Perhaps the MCU’s best-reviewed film to date, Black Panther examined race, gender, and
        power issues through an Afrofuturist lens and featured an ensemble cast that included Michael B. Jordan, Lupita
        Nyong’o, Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, and Letitia Wright. The Black Panther and his fellow Wakandans figured
        prominently in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), the two-part blockbuster culmination
        of 10 years of filmmaking in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

    <h5>Black Panther's Death</h5>
    <div class="p4div">
      <p>
        His death in August 2020, following a private battle with colon cancer, came as a shock to many people. Boseman
        died as Black Panther director Ryan Coogler was working on the script for the sequel. After Boseman died,
        arguments and theories flew over whether his role would be recast. A popular theory among the Black Panther
        fandom—that Shuri would take over as the Black Panther, as she did in the comic books—became the plot of the
        sequel.

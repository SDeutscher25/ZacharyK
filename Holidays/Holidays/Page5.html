        <p>
            Carving pumpkins, trick-or-treating, and wearing scary costumes are some of the time-honored traditions of
            Halloween. Yet, the Halloween holiday has its roots in the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, a pagan
            religious celebration to welcome the harvest at the end of summer, when people would light bonfires and wear
            costumes to ward off ghosts.

                    It is based on a legend about a man named Stingy Jack who claimed to have trapped the Devil and only
                    let him go on the condition that Jack would never go to Hell. But when Jack died, he learned that
                    Heaven did not want his soul, so he was forced to wander the Earth as a ghost for eternity.

                    In order to avoid being terrorized by all the evil spirits walking the Earth during Samhain, the

                    One theory is that during Samhain, Celtic people would leave food out to appease the spirits traveling the Earth at
                    night. Over time, people began to dress as these unearthly beings in exchange for similar offerings
                    of food and drink.

    <h1>Future Goals</h1>
    <div class="highschool">
    <h2>High School</h2>
    <p>My goals in high school are as follows: Win state in both baseball and basketball, graduate with at least a 3.8 GPA, and make lasting memories with my peers.</p>
    <p>I think that we have a real shot at winning state basketball both of the next two years. We have the talent and the system, the pieces just need to align correctly. In baseball, there is a real shot at winning next year as a lot of our roster will be returning. </p>
    <p>A 3.8 GPA is very manegable, considering right now I have a 3.95. A 3.8 GPA, with good testing scores, would almost guarantee me a scholorship at several colleges.</p>
    <p>Finally, I want to look back on high school and remember it as a time where I was able to just hang out with my buddies and live life. I don't want to remember being stressed or hating high school.</p>

    <div class="after">
    <h2>After High School</h2>
    <p>My goals after high school are as follows: Graduate College with a degree and a plan, raise respectful children, and coach my kids through sports</p>
    <p>Graduating college is a must for me. It will help me figure out my plan for life and major in a field that I enjoy and would be comfortable living my life doing. Also, college can be a great place to meet new friends and make lasting memories. </p>
    <p>I want to raise respectful children that put other people on notice. I want them to learn proper manners from a young age and teach them to be kind to everyone as they don't know what they are going through. </p>
    <p>Finally, my goal is to become a coach. I have always loved analyzing the game and strategizing. Being a coach, especially for my kids, would be a great way to stick around sports while still getting to be in the action. Also, I think that with my experience as a player, I would make a tremendous coach. </p>

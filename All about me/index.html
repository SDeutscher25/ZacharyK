        <h2><b>Why Am I Interested In Sports</b></h2>
        <p>Ever since I was young, I have had a strong interest in playing and watching sports.</p>
        <p>I develop strategy in my head and think about the game in depth.</p>
        <p>It helps keep me accountable about the things that I do and the work I put in.</p>

        <h4><b>Future Goals</b></h4>
        <p>
            My dream is to get a college education and become a coach, preferably basketball but baseball is fine as
            well.

        <p />
        <p>I want to coach high school or college. Also, I want to raise great children and have a happy family.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, I would coach my sons team until high school stay in touch with my mom and live
        somewhere warm with a beach. </p>
